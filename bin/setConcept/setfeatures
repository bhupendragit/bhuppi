A Set is a Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.
 It models the mathematical set abstraction.
 The Set interface contains only methods inherited from Collection and 
 	adds the restriction that duplicate elements are prohibited
 	
 	
Set also adds a stronger contract on the behavior of the equals and hashCode operations, 
allowing Set instances to be compared meaningfully even if their implementation types differ
