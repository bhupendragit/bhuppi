Ordered – Elements in arraylist preserve their ordering which is by default the order in which they were added to the list.
Index based – Elements can be randomly accessed using index positions. Index start with '0'.
Dynamic resizing – ArrayList grows dynamically when more elements needs to be added than it’s current size.
Non synchronized – ArrayList is not synchronized, by default. Programmer needs to use synchronized keyword appropiately or simply use Vector class.
Duplicates allowed – We can add duplicate elements in arraylist. It is not possible in sets.
